# Retail Recommendation System

A personalized recommendation system for an e-commerce platform, which suggests products based on user preferences, browsing history, and contextual factors. The system uses a hybrid approach of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and association rule mining to generate recommendations.

This project is developed as part of the third-year first-semester project for the Information Retrieval and Web Analytics module.
